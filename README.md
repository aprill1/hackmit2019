# HackMIT 2019 Project: Filler Word Tracker

## Overview
**Filler Word Tracker** allows you to record audio clips and displays the number of filler words you use! Speech-to-text transcription is powered by the [Rev.ai API].

## Setup Instructions
The tracker currently is only compatible with Google Chrome. You will also need to disable web security to run this project locally. To do so, quit all instances of Google Chrome, and run `open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir` in a terminal (in the future, this would be mitigated).
